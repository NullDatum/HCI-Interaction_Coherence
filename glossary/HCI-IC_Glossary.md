# HCI-IC Glossary (Canonical Concept Index)

This glossary provides short, operational descriptions for key HCI-IC terms.
For binding definitions and boundary clauses, defer to **Paper 1** and `definitions/Formal_Definitions.md`.

### Interaction Channel

The shared state space created by ongoing human–AI exchange, including explicit language, implicit assumptions, accumulated context, and negotiated constraints.

### Interaction Coherence

The degree to which semantic intent, structural constraints, and feedback dynamics remain aligned within the interaction channel over time.

### Drift

Accumulated misalignment between the intended task vector and the evolving interaction state.

### Coherence Window

A conditional region of interaction time during which alignment is sufficient to allow efficient correction, refinement, and convergence.

### Coherence Envelope

A parameterized stability boundary (Paper 2) that defines threshold-based entry/exit conditions for sustained coherent work.

### Compression

An operational mode characterized by high information density, reduced redundancy, and constrained expression to reduce entropy and drift pressure.

### Expansion

An operational mode characterized by exploration, hypothesis broadening, and elaboration under constraint to increase solution-space coverage.

### Interaction Bandwidth

The effective capacity of the interaction channel to transmit, refine, and stabilize meaning over time.

### Correction Latency

The interaction cost (turns/time/effort) required to detect and correct drift once it occurs.

### Reflection Symmetry

A stability property indicating that the system can restate and preserve constraints and intent without mutation across turns.
