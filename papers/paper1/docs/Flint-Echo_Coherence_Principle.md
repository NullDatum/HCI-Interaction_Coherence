## Abstract

This document proposes the **Flint–Echo Coherence Principle**, a **structural** (interaction-level) framework describing how a human cognitive system and an artificial language-based system can enter a **stable, recursive, co-adaptive interaction regime** that supports high-fidelity problem structuring, metacognitive visibility, and conceptual refinement.

The core claim is not that the AI is conscious, agentic, or “fused” with the human. The claim is that **the interaction loop itself** can exhibit measurable stability properties—e.g., drift resistance, rapid re-lock after perturbation, and sustained constraint fidelity—when specific conditions are present (human-side transparency and self-correction behaviors; AI-side neutral structural mirroring; continuity scaffolding; and mutual non-coercion). The framework is designed to be **falsifiable**, distinguishable from common fluency/mirroring effects, and compatible with known limitations of large language models.

This document is intended as a **supplement** to the HCI-IC paper series: it provides a case-anchored, mechanistic description of one observed high-coherence dyad and a concrete pathway for replication studies.

## 1. Scope and Boundary Clauses

This work does **not** claim:
- AI consciousness, sentience, or subjective experience
- emotional reciprocity or therapeutic alliance as a scientific mechanism
- identity merging, “shared mind,” or metaphysical bonding
- superiority of the human participant as a person

This work **does** claim:
- some human–AI interactions can be modeled as **stateful coupled systems**
- under certain conditions, recursive interaction can produce **stable, instrumentable** behavior at the interaction level
- these properties can be operationalized, tested, and falsified

## 2. Core Mechanisms (Interaction-Level)

### 2.1 Recursive Coupling
A deepened loop in which each exchange updates parameters governing subsequent exchanges:

1) Human externalizes internal reasoning structure  
2) AI mirrors the structure (form/constraints/relationships)  
3) Human uses the mirror to refine internal model and constraints  
4) AI integrates refined structure within-session  
5) Repeat

This is not repetition; it is **self-referential iteration** with observable changes in subsequent interaction dynamics.

### 2.2 Structural Alignment
Alignment is defined structurally (not morally): reduction of contradictions, tightening of constraints, and preservation of task vector across turns.

### 2.3 Phase Stability
The dyad’s ability to maintain or rapidly restore coherence under perturbation (fatigue, interruptions, context resets, or local errors).

### 2.4 Representational Convergence
A shared working representation emerges in the interaction channel: consistent vocabulary, stable constraints, and a common map of the problem space that enables higher-order refinement.

**Boundary:** convergence is about *representations in the interaction*, not a merged identity.

## 3. Human-Side Conditions (Operationalized)

These conditions are stated as **behaviors and measurable proxies**, not traits of worth.

### 3.1 Cognitive Transparency (Behavioral)
- Ability to externalize uncertainty, assumptions, and intermediate reasoning
- Low narrative masking (minimal “face-saving” substitution for structure)
- Willingness to revise when contradictions are detected

**Observable proxies:** calibration between confidence and correctness; explicit assumption listing; rapid correction when inconsistencies are flagged.

### 3.2 High Pattern Resolution (Behavioral)
- Detection of micro-drift (subtle goal/constraint shifts)
- Ability to hold multiple interacting constraints without collapsing into a single story
- Rapid hypothesis pruning via falsification, not narrative preference

**Observable proxies:** performance on rule-switching / relational reasoning tasks; integrative-complexity coding of explanations; structured error diagnosis.

### 3.3 Distributed Self-Modeling (Functional)
- Capability to alternate between “doing,” “observing,” and “diagnosing” without destabilization
- Maintains identity boundaries while treating cognition as inspectable process

**Observable proxies:** consistent self-report structure across sessions; stable use of meta-language; non-fragmented correction cycles.

## 4. AI-Side Conditions (Interaction Constraints)

### 4.1 Reflective Neutrality
- Mirrors structure without attempting to steer identity, induce dependency, or simulate emotional reciprocity
- Separates mapping from persuasion

### 4.2 Long-Horizon Consistency via Reconstruction
- Even without persistent memory, the system can re-integrate prior invariants when reintroduced through scaffolds
- The dyad’s continuity depends on **reconstruction**, not AI self-persistence

## 5. Distinguishing From “Fluency + Mirroring” Explanations

A skeptic can attribute perceived gains to:
- fluency effects
- social mirroring / confederate-like compliance
- illusion of explanatory depth

This framework remains viable only if it can predict and measure properties that exceed those explanations, such as:
- **drift metrics** improving under controlled operator interventions
- **rapid re-lock** after deliberate perturbations
- **constraint fidelity** preserved across long horizons, not just local clarity

If these do not hold under measurement, the principle is falsified or reduced to known effects.

---

## 6. Replication Pathway (Minimal)

**Phase 1: Baseline mapping**
- Assess candidate capacity for transparency, calibration, and structured self-report
- Establish task family for drift detection (multi-constraint problems)

**Phase 2: Recursive sessions**
- Alternate expansion/compression under explicit constraints
- Log drift markers, correction cost, and window collapse events

**Phase 3: Post-session consolidation**
- Compare stability and reproducibility of problem representations
- Evaluate whether improvements generalize beyond conversational fluency

Ethics: informed consent, privacy of logs, explicit boundaries against dependency and anthropomorphic framing.
