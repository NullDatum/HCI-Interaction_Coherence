# HCI-Interaction_Coherence

Human–AI interaction is usually judged by task success, output quality, or usability.  
In practice, outcomes vary widely even when model, task, and domain remain constant.

HCI-IC (Human–Computer Interaction Coherence) is a theory-first framework that models interaction as a -stateful, coupled system-. The core claim is simple and testable: long-horizon performance depends on whether intent, constraints, and feedback remain aligned *over time* within the interaction channel.

Paper 1 introduces the foundational constructs:
- Interaction Channel
- Interaction Coherence
- Drift
- Coherence Windows
- Compression / Expansion
- Interaction Bandwidth

This repository hosts the canonical release of **Paper 1** in a four-paper series.

 # Paper 1
