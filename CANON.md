# Canon Order, Scope, and Interpretation Rules

**Repository:** HCI-Interaction_Coherence
**Purpose:** Establish the binding canon order and scope rules for all documents in this repository.

---

## 1) Canon Order (Binding)

Interpretation, citation, and discussion must follow this priority order:

1. **Paper 1 (FINAL):** HCI-IC — Core Theory & Constructs
2. **Paper 2 (forthcoming):** Parameterization & Measurement
3. **Paper 3 (forthcoming):** Applied Protocols & Replication Posture
4. **Paper 4 (forthcoming):** Operational Training & Technique
5. **Primer (Recursive Agency):** Entry bridge only; not a substitute for the series
6. **Glossary / Definitions:** Canonical term anchors (supporting, not higher authority than Paper 1)
7. **Docs / Notes / Artifacts:** Supporting material; never override the papers

If any supporting document conflicts with Papers 1–4, the papers govern.

---

## 2) Scope Lock (Binding)

This repository claims and evaluates **interaction structure**, not mind or ontology.

In-scope:

* Interaction Channel (stateful shared context)
* Interaction Coherence (alignment persistence)
* Drift (misalignment accumulation)
* Coherence Windows / Envelope (conditional stability regions)
* Compression / Expansion (operational modes)
* Interaction Bandwidth (effective capacity of the channel)
* Measurement and replication artifacts (logs, traces, checkable computations)

Out-of-scope:

* Claims about sentience, consciousness, intent, moral standing
* Claims about internal model mechanisms or privileged access
* Identity-based superiority claims about persons or systems
* Harm-enabling operationalization

---

## 3) Interpretation Rule (Anti-Misread)

If a term has a common public meaning (e.g., “agency”), that public meaning is **non-binding** here.

Binding meaning is defined only by:

* Paper 1 definitions and boundaries
* Glossary / Definitions files (when present)

When uncertain, default to the **narrowest measurable interpretation** consistent with the papers.

---

## 4) Versioning and Edits

* Canon documents are updated via explicit commits and release tags.
* No silent scope expansion.
* If language changes meaning, a version note is required.
