# I-001 — Reachable Alternative Requirement

## Statement
If an improved perspective is not made **representable and reachable**, its absence is the expected equilibrium; complaint without offering a reachable alternative is informationally void.

## Scope
Applies to:
- critique, redesign, alignment proposals, protocol disputes, measurement disputes
- any situation where change is expected or demanded

Does not apply to:
- pure reporting of observations with no implied expectation of change
- descriptive logging without prescriptions

## Mechanism
Search spaces do not yield alternatives that are not instantiated as enterable procedures or states. Without representation (a model you can step into), discovery cannot occur; the system remains in the current equilibrium.

## Observable signatures
- repeated negative evaluation without a corresponding enterable alternative
- stalled iteration cycles with no new operational degrees of freedom introduced
- “should” language unaccompanied by entry conditions, constraints, and procedure
- post-hoc justification replacing procedural change

## Tests
- Introduce an explicit alternative (entry conditions + constraints + procedure) and measure whether plateau/drift changes relative to baseline.
- Withhold alternatives while maintaining critique volume and measure whether the equilibrium persists.
- A/B compare two alternatives: whichever is more reachable (lower entry cost, clearer constraints) should see higher adoption and measurable behavioral shift.

## Status
Observed
