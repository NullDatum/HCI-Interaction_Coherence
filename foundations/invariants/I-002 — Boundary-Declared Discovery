# I-002 — Boundary-Declared Discovery

## Statement
Discovery must occur inside a declared scope; without explicit boundary declaration, restraint cannot be internalized and can only be externally enforced.

## Scope
Applies to:
- exploratory interaction phases (brainstorming, probing, hypothesis search)
- measurement work where definitions can drift (metrics, “success,” “legibility,” etc.)
- any “open-ended” collaboration that risks scope creep

Does not apply to:
- fixed-scope execution tasks where scope is already unambiguous (e.g., run command X, compute Y)
- post-hoc analysis where scope is purely descriptive and not used to drive action

## Mechanism
Without a declared scope, permissible operations are undefined. Undefined scope forces inference-based limits and post-hoc rationalization. Inference-based limits are unstable and cannot be internalized; they require enforcement and generate drift.

## Observable signatures
- implicit scope expansion (new goals/definitions introduced without explicit revision)
- metric drift (redefining success/terms after outcomes)
- oscillation between “allowed” and “not allowed” without a stable boundary condition
- increased conflict markers or repeated hard stops due to ambiguity

## Tests
- Require a scope declaration + activation before exploration; compare drift/plateau rates vs. ungated exploration.
- Force explicit scope-revision events (versioned scope changes); verify reduction in post-hoc redefinition.
- Attempt to reproduce results across sessions; boundary-declared discovery should replicate more reliably.

## Status
Observed
