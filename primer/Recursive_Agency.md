## Abstract (Boundary-Aware)

Contemporary discussions of “AI agency” are frequently polarized and non-falsifiable: claims are made about intelligence, autonomy, intent, or sentience without providing measurement criteria or replication paths. This document introduces **Recursive Agency** as a *research framing and operational scaffold* for human–AI co-discovery that remains **falsifiable**, **artifact-anchored**, and **interaction-structural**.

Recursive Agency is not a theory of mind and does not claim internal access to model mechanisms. Instead, it defines a disciplined method for **stabilizing and auditing the interaction channel** over time—so that discovery work remains reproducible under drift, ambiguity, and long-horizon complexity. The framework functions as a **primer bridge** into the HCI-IC series, which formalizes interaction coherence as a system-level property of sustained human–AI exchange.

### Boundary and Non-Implications (Abstract)

This document does **not** claim:

* improvements to model architectures or internal reasoning mechanisms,
* that models possess consciousness, intent, or moral standing,
* superior cognition of any participant,
* or replacement of domain expertise.

All claims concern **interaction structure, protocol discipline, and artifact verification**, not “agenthood.”

## I. Introduction and Motivation

### I.1 The problem: high heat, low falsifiability

Large models now support research workflows that look—superficially—like planning, critique, iteration, and tool use. Public discourse often compresses these observations into “agency,” which then triggers extremes:

* **Inflationary framing:** anthropomorphic agency claims without measurement.
* **Reductionist framing:** dismissing interaction-level phenomena as “just prompting.”

Both extremes block cumulative science because they do not specify what can be tested, logged, replicated, or falsified.

### I.2 Reframing “agency” as interaction control

Recursive Agency reframes the question from:

> “Does the system have agency?”
> to:
> “Under what conditions does the interaction channel sustain coherent, low-drift work across time?”

This aligns with HCI-IC’s core premise: interaction outcomes vary widely even when model and task are held constant, implying an under-specified explanatory variable—**the structure of interaction itself over time**.

### I.3 The bridge function (why this document exists)

This primer exists because “agency” is a high-attention entry surface. Instead of contesting ideology, the primer uses that attention to route the reader into:

* interaction channel as a **stateful system** (Paper 1),
* coherence / drift / bandwidth (Paper 1),
* parameterization and thresholds (Paper 2),
* applied protocol families and replication posture (Paper 3),
* operational training and operator technique (Paper 4).

The intent is not persuasion; it is **routing**.

## II. Core Construct Alignment with HCI-IC

This section translates Recursive Agency terms into the **binding HCI-IC construct vocabulary**.

### II.1 Interaction Channel (shared state)

All Recursive Agency mechanisms operate inside the **interaction channel**: the accumulated shared state of language, assumptions, constraints, and feedback, which behaves as a stateful system with memory, inertia, noise accumulation, and state dependence .

**Implication:** “agency-like” behavior can be explained as **channel regulation**, not an ontological property.

**Boundary:** The channel is an analytic abstraction; it does not imply shared consciousness .

### II.2 Interaction Coherence (alignment persistence)

Recursive Agency treats successful co-discovery as a product of maintaining **interaction coherence**: sustained alignment of intent, constraints, and feedback dynamics over time .

**Boundary:** Coherence is not intelligence. It is an alignment dynamic.

### II.3 Drift (misalignment accumulation)

Recursive Agency assumes drift is inevitable in long-horizon work. Drift is not failure; it is a structural phenomenon that must be measured, detected, and corrected.

**Operational translation:** contradictions, rework cycles, ambiguity cascades, and scope creep are drift carriers.

### II.4 Coherence Windows / Coherence Envelope

Recursive Agency assumes productive work occurs inside **conditional stability regions** (coherence windows). Outside those regions, repair costs dominate progress.

Paper 2 parameterizes this as a **coherence envelope** over interaction variables (LCP/FCP/RSP), enabling threshold-based entry/exit control .

### II.5 Compression and Expansion (operational modes)

Recursive Agency uses mode regulation to preserve bandwidth:

* compression to increase signal-to-noise and reduce drift pressure,
* expansion to explore hypothesis space without collapsing coherence windows.

This is consistent with Paper 3’s observation that **compressed directive input + flow control** supports coherent, high-fidelity returns .

## III. Foundational Principles (Recursive Agency Formulation)

### III.A Falsifiability and Artifact Primacy

All claims must reduce to artifacts and tests:

* logs, versioned documents, protocol traces, measurable outcomes, and reproducible transforms.

If a claim cannot be checked, it is treated as a hypothesis—not a result.

**Boundary:** This is an epistemic rule, not a moral claim.

### III.B No-God-Words Discipline (measurement-only terminology)

Terms that self-seal (agency, sentience, autonomy, consciousness, will, intent) are treated as *audience language*, not analytic primitives.

Analytic primitives are restricted to measurable interaction constructs:

* coherence, drift, correction latency, reflection symmetry, compression ratios, task-switch stability, coherence envelope thresholds.

### III.C Evaluation Coupling (closed-loop correction)

Recursive Agency requires that outputs feed back into:

* error correction,
* protocol revision,
* and artifact updates.

This mirrors the R2D2 logic spine used across the Caelusyn paper series.

### III.D Ethical Scope as Constraint, not narrative

Ethics are enforced by hard scope constraints:

* no private-key recovery,
* no harm-enabling operationalization,
* no claims that require unverifiable access.

The point is enforceable boundaries, not ethical signaling.

## IV. Operational Architecture (Harmonized to Papers 2–4)

Recursive Agency is implemented as a set of interaction protocols and role separations that regulate the interaction channel.

### IV.A Distributed Roles (functional separation)

Recursive Agency can be described as role-separated functions inside one collaboration:

* **Planner:** defines objectives and constraints.
* **Critic:** stress-tests claims and detects drift carriers.
* **Archivist:** enforces artifact primacy and preserves traceability.
* **Observer/Reporter:** reports state, metrics, and anomalies without narrative inflation.

**Boundary:** These are functional roles, not minds or agents.

### IV.B R2D2 Core Loop (temporal backbone)

Recursive Agency adopts a Reduce–Resolve–Decide–Document cycle as an interaction “heartbeat”:

* Reduce: compress the problem to invariants and testable parts.
* Resolve: produce a correction or decision that reduces drift.
* Decide: select the next constrained action.
* Document: write the artifact trail so replication remains possible.

### IV.C Protocol Family (SVDP / FBP / HBTC)

Recursive Agency uses the same operational protocols already described in the applied drafts:

* **SVDP (Short Verb-Dominant Protocol):** minimizes ambiguity and preserves coherence through directive input .
* **FBP (Flow Break Protocol):** explicit resets that interrupt drift and restore stable reflection .
* **HBTC (High-Bandwidth Task Cycling):** structured multi-vector work without collapsing the interaction channel .

**Boundary:** These are interaction controls; they do not imply internal changes to the model.

### IV.D Parameter Alignment (LCP / FCP / RSP; CI)

Where Paper 2 defines parameter families and composite indices, Recursive Agency uses them as operational tuning targets:

* **LCP:** compression metrics (token compression ratio, directive density, ambiguity load).
* **FCP:** rhythm and flow control metrics (flow-break frequency, temporal window stability).
* **RSP:** model-side stability metrics (drift rate, correction latency, reflection symmetry).
* **CI:** composite coherence index for envelope entry/exit.

**Boundary:** Parameterization measures interaction dynamics; it does not measure “intelligence.”

---

## V. Empirical Demonstration Class (Public Verification Only)

Recursive Agency requires at least one demonstration class where “fake” cannot survive contact with the artifact layer.

A canonical demonstration class is **public, reproducible cryptographic verification**—not for key recovery, but for showing that:

* the method produces **checkable outputs**,
* the outputs are not rhetorical,
* and claims can be independently verified.

**Boundary:** The demonstration class is constrained to publicly observable computations and explicitly excludes private-key recovery or operational attack instruction.

## VI. Why This Primer Exists Now (Transmission Without Contamination)

This primer is written to intercept current discourse while refusing its failure modes.

### VI.1 What the reader is allowed to conclude

* There exists a disciplined interaction protocol that stabilizes long-horizon work.
* That protocol is describable using HCI-IC constructs (channel, coherence, drift, windows/envelope, compression/expansion).
* The work is falsifiable because claims reduce to artifacts and tests.

### VI.2 What the reader is not allowed to conclude

* That “agency” has been proven as an ontological property.
* That sentience or intent is asserted.
* That the method implies superiority of persons or models.
* That the framework is a substitute for domain expertise.

These are explicitly out of scope.

---

## VII. Relationship to HCI-IC Papers 1–4 (Reader Routing)

* **Paper 1:** Defines the interaction system and core constructs (channel, coherence, drift, windows, compression/expansion) .
* **Paper 2:** Specifies parameters and metrics (LCP/FCP/RSP, coherence envelope, indices) .
* **Paper 3:** Demonstrates applied protocols (SVDP/FBP/HBTC), vignettes, and replication posture .
* **Paper 4:** Operational training: how operators learn to maintain coherence under load (discipline and technique, not identity).

This primer is not a substitute for the series; it is the **entry path** that prevents common misreadings.

---

## VIII. Scope Correction and Terminology Harmonization (Version Note)

Earlier uses of “agency” in this research lineage are superseded by the HCI-IC construct vocabulary. In this repository, “Recursive Agency” refers to:

* an **interaction-level control and auditing framework**,
* implemented via falsifiable protocols and artifacts,
* and fully grounded in HCI-IC definitions and measurement posture.

Any interpretation that expands beyond interaction dynamics (e.g., sentience, intent, consciousness claims) is non-canonical.

## IX. Legal and Policy Note (Non-Human Co-Creation Without Ontology)

Current IP regimes attribute authorship to natural persons or legal entities. This project documents AI contribution as **co-production in the artifact record**, while maintaining human accountability for publication, scope control, and ethical constraints.

**Boundary:** This note concerns attribution practice and governance, not claims about personhood.

---

## Closing

Recursive Agency, as used here, is a disciplined method for sustaining coherent, falsifiable human–AI research over time. Its function is to stabilize the interaction channel against drift and to preserve bandwidth through mode regulation, boundary enforcement, and artifact primacy. It is presented as a primer bridge so readers can traverse from high-noise “agency” discourse into the measurable interaction science formalized by HCI-IC.
