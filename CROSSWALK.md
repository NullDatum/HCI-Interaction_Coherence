# Primer → HCI-IC Papers 1–4 Crosswalk (Reader Routing)

This table routes “agency” entry language into **HCI-IC’s binding construct vocabulary**.

| Entry Surface (Primer)              | HCI-IC Construct             | What It Means (Interaction-Level)                                       | Where to Read Next                       |

| “Artifacts and tests”               | Measurement posture          | Claims reduce to logs, traces, and replication paths                    | Paper 2 + Repo artifacts                 |

**Rule:** If any public meaning conflicts with this crosswalk, **Paper 1 governs**.
