# Formal Definitions (Operational, Measurement-Safe)

These definitions are operational and scoped to interaction structure.
They do not assert ontological claims about mind, agency, or intelligence.

### 1) Interaction Channel

**Definition:** The shared state space created by ongoing human–AI exchange, including explicit language, implicit assumptions, accumulated context, and negotiated constraints.

**Boundary:** Analytic abstraction only; no implication of shared consciousness or cognitive fusion.

### 2) Interaction Coherence

**Definition:** The degree to which semantic intent, structural constraints, and feedback dynamics remain aligned within the interaction channel over time.

**Boundary:** Not intelligence; not a trait of user or model; not a property of individual messages.

### 3) Drift

**Definition:** Accumulated misalignment between the intended task vector and the evolving interaction state.

**Boundary:** Structural phenomenon, not incompetence or error by participants.

### 4) Coherence Window

**Definition:** A conditional stability region of interaction time during which correction is low-cost and convergence remains feasible.

**Boundary:** Not attention span, fatigue, or “flow” psychology; a stability condition of the interaction system.

### 5) Compression

**Definition:** An operational mode characterized by increased signal-to-noise ratio via reduced redundancy and constrained expression.

**Boundary:** Not stylistic minimalism; evaluated only by its effect on alignment.

### 6) Expansion

**Definition:** An operational mode characterized by exploratory generation and elaboration under constraint to increase solution-space coverage.

**Boundary:** Not verbosity preference; evaluated only by its effect on drift pressure and coherence window stability.

### 7) Interaction Bandwidth

**Definition:** The effective capacity of the interaction channel to transmit, refine, and stabilize meaning over time.

**Boundary:** Not token throughput, latency, model size, or cognitive capacity.
